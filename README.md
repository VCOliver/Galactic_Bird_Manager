A simple college project in C to manage space flight reservations

## Context
It's the year 2030. Billionaire Jeff Elon Branson begins suborbital voyages of his most
recent company Galatic Birds, in which ordinary citizens can take trips to the Kármán Line,
located 100 km above sea level.

flights and bookings made is needed.  

The flights are represented by the following data: flight number, maximum number of passengers,
departure date and time, flight status (active or cancelled).
